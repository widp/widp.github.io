title: Fundus Vessel Segmentation
desc: Segmenting blood vessels from images of the eye
---

[This github repository](http://github.com/tejaswidp/fundus_vessel_segmentation)
contains Matlab code of algorithms which could be used for blood
vessel segmentation from fundus images.

The algorithms are from
[this ieee](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7911975/) paper. The
complete source code including data and all pieces of the processing
pipeline is available in the [bitbucket
repository](https://bitbucket.org/tejaswidp/aprop-nn/src).
